Anti-Patent Affero GPL (PAGPL) version 3.0.3, 2010-08-10
-------------------------------------------------

The software is distributed under a modificated version of the
"GNU Affero GPLv3", but with the following additional restrictions
to (ab)use of patents.


1. Definition of "patent tainted status".

If the licensee is abusing patents of type stated in section 2, it gets
into the "pantent tainted status", thereby looses *all* rights granted
by this license and is obligated to further obligations according to
section 4. This status applies to *all* software published under this
license, will be registered in public blacklists and remains until the
de-tainting process described in section 5 is passed.


2. Tainting patents types and actions

Patent types which trigger tainting are:

* on software, logic, mathematical methods - regardless of being
  implemented on general-purpose computers or special machineries
* on data/information formats and encodings or languages
* on all kind of genetic code whatsoever
* on biologic structures and life forms in open biospheres,
  regardless of natural or artificial
* on medicine and medical use of substances found in open
  biospheres - regardless of natural or artificial
* on business methods
* patents in general with application date back over 5 years.
* patents which are either illegal or likely to loose fair trials
  under the national jurisdiction of either the application or
  the location of use

A licensee gets tainted (primary tainting) as soon as he/she:

* files a patent-violation suit or threatens to do so (with patents
  of the type stated) against anybody, except when in direct defense
  of such an action by the attacked entity against the licensee.
* using those patents for product marketing


3. Recursive tainting

If the licensee is owned or controlled, by majority of at least 50%,
by another tainted entity, the tainting applies recoursively, as long
as that ownership/controlship remains. The majority is counted by
effective shares on indirect ownership structures like holdings.

This does not apply to employees and (permanent) contractors of tainted
entities own their own (so, outside the business for the tainted enitity).


4. Consequences of tainting

At the moment of tainting, the licensee looses any rights granted by
this license and is obligated to report this to the copyright holders.

Primary-tainted are obligated to announce this issue on the usual
public relation channels.

Recursively tainted licensees are given an 4-weeks grace time to
negotiate an parallel license with the copyright holders or break
free from the tainting parent entitiy.


5. Untainting of primary-tainted licensees

For the untainting process, the primary licensee has to take back all
suits and other legal actions on and completely give up (so: delete)
the patents in question. This has to be announced publically as, and
lawful evidence has to be given directly to the copyright holders.

Recursively tainted licensees are untainted as soon as the conditions
for recursive tainting are removed - eg. when the tainted parent has
sold/given up enough shares or voting rights on the licensee - and
the copyright holders have been given lawful evidence on that.


6. License compatibility

This license is explicitly compatible with the Affero GPL in regard
of linking against or into other packages. On the other hand, the code
under this license may not be relicensed under Affero- or plain GPL
without explicit written permission by the copyright holders.
